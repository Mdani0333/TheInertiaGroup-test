backend runs on localhost--- 3000
frontend runs on localhost anyother than 3000 --- In my case 3001

Note:
-->Purchase page is named as cart page or cart.
-->Buttons are showing 'add to cart' instead of 'purchase' but functionality is same just I prefer in naming as 'cart' than 'purchase'.
-->An extra page is added which shows the 'product details' when we click on it.
-->A demo video is also uploaded with the name 'bandicam 2022-08-22 18-52-26-614' , kindly give it a view.

All other functionalities are same as guided.
thanks,
Adnan.
